**Command Line Connect Four Game:**

Simple game which lets two users play Connect Four in the command line
on a default 7 x 6 gameboard.

Users take turns entering the number of column they would like to drop
their game piece into. 

The game ends when a user gets four of their pieces in a row vertically,
horizontally or diagonally.

The purpose of this project was to build an application using
Test Driven Development.
